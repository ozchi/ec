The three evolutionary algorithms (EA1, EA2, EA3) applied to the TSP problem have shown distinct behaviors when evaluated through their diagrams:

Convergence Speed:

EA2 shines with a fast 7-hour convergence.
EA1, employing a gamut of mutation strategies, takes approximately 16 hours.
EA3, utilizing a mix of crossover techniques and a diminishing mutation rate over iterations, finalizes around 8 hours.

Convergence Smoothness:

EA2 is consistently smooth, hinting at stable exploration and exploitation within its genetic operations.
EA3's diagram exhibits more fluctuations, potentially an outcome of its varied strategies, like tournament selection.
EA1 stands intermediate, possibly a result of its combination of elite selection and dynamic mutation adjustments.

Final Result Fitness:

EA2 leads with an optimal 55981.
EA1, through its diverse mutation mechanisms, reaches a commendable 58029.
EA3's performance, although adaptable, .

Strategy Specifics:

EA1's shifting mutation rate, initiating with extensive exploration and transitioning to detailed refinement, contrasts with EA2's more unchanging approach. However, EA2's modular structure might grant it efficiency gains.
EA3's adoption of tournament selection introduces a degree of randomness, potentially explaining its wavering progress.
Conclusion:
While EA2 stands out for both speed and fitness, EA1 and EA3 have their merits. EA1's capability to dynamically adjust mutation rates suggests adaptability to different problem landscapes. EA3's tournament selection, despite introducing randomness, 
could be beneficial in certain scenarios where breaking local optima is essential. Thus, the choice of algorithm might hinge not just on performance metrics but also on the nature of the TSP instance and the desired trade-offs.
