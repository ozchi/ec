The code implements an evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Initial individuals are generated using unspecified methods from the Population class. Parents are selected via tournament selection. Offsprings undergo order crossover with a rate of 0.2, and mutation (choices: inversion, swap, scramble, or insert) with a decaying rate starting from 0.8. The new generation is formed with 10% elitism and random sampling. The algorithm repeats for different population sizes and runs for a maximum of 20,000 generations. The best-performing individual is saved in a text file. Hyperparameters: CROSSOVER_RATE=0.2, mutation_rate=0.8, max_generations=20000, elitism_ratio=0.1.

Justifying the design:
The algorithm is designed for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a balance of exploitation and exploration. For parent selection, tournament_selection is used for its efficiency and effectiveness. The crossover phase employs a fixed rate (CROSSOVER_RATE) to balance parent traits and new combinations. Mutation is particularly diverse, utilizing random choices among four methods like swap_mutate and inversion_mutate to escape local minima. A decaying mutation rate ensures fine-tuning over generations. The replacement strategy employs elitism, controlled by elitism_ratio, to keep the best solutions while allowing new, diverse solutions to enter the population. This multi-faceted approach is aimed at efficiently finding near-optimal solutions.
